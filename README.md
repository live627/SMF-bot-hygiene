# SMF Bot Hygiene

## Overview:
This is my sample robots.txt file, and the portion of .htaccess that I use to restrict access to bots.

Everybody's site is a bit different, but I am offering these as starter packs for folks running SMF sites.  

## Limitations:
* I restrict attachments in robots.txt, as you need to be a registered forum user to access them in my forum.  Your forum may have a different approach.
